# Goolge Trends V.S. Stock Fluctuation

This repo is used to play around with the data provided by Google Trends. 

Google Trends support topic search, which means if you type apple, it can provide the option of apple company, the results of which will concentrate on the Apple Inc. (exclude apple fruit).

I use this repo to explore the relationship between seach interest and stock market fluctuation of a certain company. Some plots are saved in the data folder.
